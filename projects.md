# My Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on. Each project represents a learning opportunity and a chance to apply new skills.

## Project 1: [Project Name]

This project analyzes tract-level economic opportunity gaps across Allegheny County using ACS and FFIEC data. I built a merged national-to-local dataset of 84,000+ census tracts, constructed labor, education, housing, and infrastructure indicators, and created interactive visualizations to identify where disadvantage compounds geographically. The analysis shows that low-income neighborhoods face systematically lower employment, lower Bachelor's degree attainment, weaker broadband access, and higher housing instability — and that these challenges cluster spatially rather than appearing randomly. I also identify “success story” low-income tracts that outperform expectations, highlighting potential models for place-based policy intervention.

**What I Learned**: 
- Low-income tracts experience unemployment rates roughly 40–50% higher than affluent areas.
- The education gap is concentrated at Bachelor’s degree attainment, not lower credentials.
- Broadband and housing vacancy are uniquely severe local challenges in Allegheny County.
- Disadvantage clusters geographically, supporting targeted place-based policy.
- A small set of low-income tracts achieve high employment, showing resilience is possible.
